    `Natural language processing strives to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data-and respond with text or speech of their own-in much the same way humans do.`,
    `Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science-and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI-concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.`,
    `NLP combines computational linguistics-rule-based modeling of human language-with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to 'understand' its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer's intent and sentiment.`,
    `NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly-even in real time. There's a good chance you've interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences.`,
    `There's a good chance you've interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.`,
    `There is a revolution occurring in brain science. Not long ago it was thought that the brain you were born with was the brain you would die with and that the brain cells you had at birth were the maximum number you would ever possess. The brain was thought to be hardwired to function in predetermined ways. It turns out that this is not true. The brain is not hardwired; it's 'soft-wired' by experience.`,
    `The new discoveries in neuroscience shed light on how you can maximize your potential and minimize your vulnerabilities. I will
    describe how to apply these findings to rewire your brain so that you can feel calm and positive. So much hinges on these two abilities: by learning to be calm and positive, you can improve your ability to focus, face challenges, reach your goals, and be happy.`,
    `Learning to be calm means feeling less tense, less anxious, and
    less easily stressed. There are parts of your brain that, when not
    tamed, tend to overreact and add to needless tension, anxiety, and
    stress. In this book I'll describe how to get those parts rewired. The
    bottom line is this: how you train yourself to think, feel, and behave
    on a regular basis will rewire your brain and allow you to be calm
    and focused.`,
    `The brain weighs just three pounds, yet it's one of the most
    advanced organs in the body. It has a hundred billion nerve cells,
    called neurons, and many more support cells. That's equivalent to
    the number of stars in our galaxy.`,
    `For both sexes, the right hemisphere processes visual and spatial information, enabling you to grasp the big picture. The right
    hemisphere pays more attention to the context or the gist of a situation. The left hemisphere, in contrast, is more adept at details,
    categories, and linearly arranged information such as language. The
    right hemisphere is more active when you're learning something
    new. Once the knowledge becomes routine and overlearned, the
    left hemisphere comes more into play. This is another reason that
    language is processed by the left hemisphere.`,
    `There is always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.`,
    `You can't rely on how you look to sustain you, what sustains us, what is fundamentally beautiful is compassion; for yourself and your those around you.`,
    `One of the lessons that I grew up with was to always stay true to yourself and never let what somebody else says distract you from your goals.`
